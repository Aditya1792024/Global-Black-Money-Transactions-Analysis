<h1>Global Black Money Transactions Analysis</h1>
<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
<p> In this project, I used SQL through SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) to sharpen my skills and deepen my understanding of various SQL concepts. To practice SQL, I worked with a dataset on global black-money transactions, specifically focusing on illegal transactions that occurred worldwide in 2013. The dataset contained a total of 10,000 records, capturing details of black-money transactions across different countries. </p>
<p> To analyze this data, I approached it from multiple angles by developing various problem statements and solving them through SQL queries. Leveraging SQL allowed me to uncover critical insights, trends, patterns, and key findings within the dataset, leading to a comprehensive understanding of its intricacies. The full list of problem statements explored in this project is provided below. </p>
<p> Throughout the project, I practiced a wide range of SQL concepts, from foundational topics like SELECT, UPDATE, WHERE, BETWEEN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY statements to more advanced topics like views, stored procedures, CTEs, and joins. I also utilized various aggregation functions (e.g., SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()) as well as window and date functions (e.g., DENSE_RANK(), MONTH(), YEAR()). This project gave me valuable hands-on experience with essential SQL concepts, enhancing my practical understanding and bringing greater clarity to each concept. </p>
